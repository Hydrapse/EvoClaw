Most existing benchmarks evaluate agents on **isolated, one-shot tasks**. But real-world workflows are not a bag of independent missions, they are continuous processes where tasks build on each other, dependencies interleave, and context accumulates over a long session.

</p>

**EvoClaw** is a general-purpose evaluation harness for **continuous tasks**. It drops an AI agent into a working environment and challenges it to complete an ordered sequence of milestones. As the agent works, EvoClaw silently extracts checkpoints, evaluates each milestone, and asynchronously unlocks downstream tasks, enabling fine-grained, per-milestone analysis without interrupting the agent's session. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/evoclaw_illustration.png" width="820" alt="How EvoClaw works: Continuous Task Evaluation with DAG, Agent Loop, and Test-Based Grading" />
</p>

Currently focused on **software evolution**, EvoClaw's architecture is designed to extend to other domains.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Test Your Model**: Out of the box, EvoClaw ships with the [EvoClaw Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.13428) (long-horizon software evolution itineraries from 7 real-world repos) and 4 pre-configured agent frameworks ([Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex](https://openai.com/index/codex/), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands)). Provide a model API key and start evaluating.

- **Bring Your Own Agent**: The agent layer is decoupled from the evaluation engine (see below). Plug in your own agent by implementing a lightweight adapter. EvoClaw also provides a per-milestone analysis framework for detailed performance breakdowns.

- **Bring Your Own Data**: Supply your own task descriptions, test environments (Docker), test list for scoring, and task dependencies. EvoClaw handles orchestration, checkpoint-based evaluation, and reporting, enabling continuous task evaluation beyond coding.

## 👋 Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/evoclaw_arch.png" width="820" alt="EvoClaw Architecture: Orchestrator, Agent Container, DAG Manager, Evaluation Cycle, and Analytics" />
</p>

Each evaluation trial works as follows:

1. An agent is dropped into a persistent Docker container with a workspace at a given starting state.
2. It receives a sequence of **task specifications** describing tasks to achieve.
3. Tasks are ordered by a **dependency DAG**---downstream tasks unlock as upstream ones are completed.
4. The agent signals completion by creating git tags (e.g., `agent-impl-milestone_001`).
5. A **watcher thread** silently detects tags, extracts artifact snapshots, and runs pre-defined automated validation in a separate, one-time task evaluation container.
6. Results, logs, and outcomes are automatically collected and analyzed per task.

## 🔧 Setup

**0. Prerequisites**

- Python >= 3.10
- Docker
- Model API access via environment variables: `UNIFIED_API_KEY` and `UNIFIED_BASE_URL`

**1. Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hydrapse/EvoClaw.git
cd EvoClaw
uv sync
```

**2. Data & Docker Images**

Workspace data is hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hyd2apse/EvoClaw-data). Docker images are hosted on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/hyd2apse).

```bash
# Download workspace data
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/hyd2apse/EvoClaw-data

# Pull all repos at once
./scripts/pull_images.sh
```

> See [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) for the full data layout, Docker image naming conventions, and manual retag instructions.

## 🚀 Usage

> Hand [`docs/running-trials.md`](docs/running-trials.md) to your agent — it has everything needed to launch trials, monitor progress, recover stuck repos autonomously, and manage trial IDs.

**1. Configure** — copy the template and edit:

```bash
cp trial_config.example.yaml trial_config.yaml
```

```yaml
# modify trial_config.yaml 
data_root: /path/to/EvoClaw-data       # where you cloned the HuggingFace dataset
trial_name: my_experiment              # name for this evaluation run
agent: claude-code                     # agent: claude-code | codex | gemini-cli | openhands
model: claude-opus-4-7                 # model identifier (use claude-opus-4-7[1m] for 1M context)
timeout: 18000                         # optional: max agent runtime per repo (seconds)
# reasoning_effort: high               # optional: low | medium | high | xhigh | max 
# repos: [navidrome, ripgrep]          # optional: run only these repos (default: all)
```

**2. Run** — evaluate across all repos:

```bash
export UNIFIED_API_KEY=sk-...
export UNIFIED_BASE_URL=https://...   # optional, for proxy or custom endpoints
# NOTE: if UNIFIED_BASE_URL is a custom domain, add it to WHITELISTED_DOMAINS
# in harness/e2e/container_setup.py — agent containers block all other outbound traffic.
python scripts/run_all.py --config trial_config.yaml
```

**3. Monitor** — check progress in another terminal:

```bash
./scripts/monitor.sh                              # auto-detects trial, compact view
./scripts/monitor.sh my_experiment --detail        # per-milestone breakdown
./scripts/monitor.sh my_experiment --full          # full table with all columns
```

> **Tip:** `run_all.py` is fire-and-forget — it spawns one detached `run_e2e` per repo and exits immediately (no `nohup` needed). Re-running the same command is the resume operation: each worker holds an `flock` on its trial dir, so the second invocation either takes over only-if-the-first-one-died, or refuses with a clear "owned by PID …" message. Add `--force` to wipe & restart the latest matching `_NNN`, or `--new` to start the next `_NNN` fresh. See [docs/running-trials.md](docs/running-trials.md) for the full behavior matrix.

> See [docs/running-trials.md](docs/running-trials.md) for the day-to-day operational runbook (launch, monitor, recover from stuck repos), and [docs/advanced.md](docs/advanced.md) for single-repo / single-milestone debugging, result collection, `e2e_config.yaml`, and lock internals.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

Below are common issues you may encounter when running evaluations, along with solutions.

**1. Network access blocked inside containers**

Agent containers enforce an iptables-based outbound whitelist — only domains needed for API access and package management are allowed (e.g., `api.anthropic.com`, `registry.npmjs.org`, `pypi.org`). Code hosting sites (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) are explicitly blocked to prevent data leakage. If your setup routes API requests through a custom proxy, make sure the proxy domain is included in `WHITELISTED_DOMAINS` in `harness/e2e/container_setup.py`.

> **Port 80 outbound blocked?** Some hosts/datacenters block plain HTTP. The harness automatically rewrites Debian/Ubuntu apt sources to HTTPS so `apt-get update` reaches mirrors via 443 — no action needed.

**2. Agent exits prematurely before completing all milestones**

Due to LLM capability limitations or agent framework issues, agents may exit without completing all milestones. For example, out of memory, hitting API errors, or getting stuck in implementation loops without submitting. EvoClaw handles this with a built-in resume mechanism that recovers the agent session and continues from where it left off:

```bash
python -m harness.e2e.run_e2e --resume-trial /path/to/trial_dir
```

When possible, the agent resumes within the same session context, preserving its memory of all previous work. If the session becomes unrecoverable (e.g., corrupted state or context overflow after many turns), EvoClaw automatically falls back to a new session. In either case, all prior code changes and git state (commits, tags) are preserved inside the container, so the agent can continue from the current codebase state.

> **Resume requires the container to exist.** `/testbed` is not bind-mounted to the host, so `docker rm` destroys all uncommitted code, in-container git history, and the agent's session cache. If the container is gone, only `--force` (full restart from the initial commit) is possible — already-submitted milestones' source snapshots remain in `evaluation/`, but `/testbed` itself reverts to the initial state.

> **Evaluation protocol**: The reported results in the EvoClaw benchmark follow a protocol where trials are resumed until all milestones are submitted and evaluated, unless three consecutive resumes yield no new submissions. We encourage reproducibility studies to follow the same setting.
